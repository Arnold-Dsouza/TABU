## 🎯 Quick Start Options

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended - No Java Required!)

**This is the easiest way to get your APK without installing anything locally.**

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for APK build"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger Build:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Actions" tab
   - Click "Build Android APK" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Wait for build to complete (5-10 minutes)

3. **Download APK:**
   - Once build completes, scroll down to "Artifacts"
   - Download "app-debug-apk"
   - Extract the ZIP file to get your APK

### Option 2: Local Build (After Installing Java)

**If you want to build locally, follow these steps:**

1. **Install Java JDK 17:**
   - Download from: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
   - Choose JDK 17 for Windows x64
   - Install and note the installation path

2. **Set Environment Variable:**
   ```powershell
   # Replace with your actual JDK path
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("JAVA_HOME", "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.10.7-hotspot", "Machine")
   ```

3. **Restart PowerShell and Run:**
   ```powershell
   # Use the automated script
   .\build-apk.ps1
   
   # OR run commands manually:
   npm run build
   npx cap sync android
   cd android
   .\gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

4. **Find Your APK:**
   - Location: `android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`
