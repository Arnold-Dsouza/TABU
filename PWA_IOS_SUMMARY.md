# iOS PWA Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Progressive Web App (PWA) features for iOS users in the TABU app.

## Implemented Features

1. **PWA Install Prompt**:
   - Custom dialog for iOS users to guide them through adding the app to their home screen
   - Detects iOS devices and only shows on Safari

2. **Service Worker**:
   - Provides offline functionality
   - Manages push notifications
   - Handles caching for better performance

3. **Web Manifest**:
   - Enhanced with proper iOS-specific metadata
   - Includes icons, theme colors, and display settings

4. **iOS Meta Tags**:
   - Added Apple-specific meta tags in the HTML head
   - Configured for full-screen mode and status bar styling

5. **Unified Notification System**:
   - Works across both Android (native) and iOS (PWA)
   - Abstracts platform differences into a single API

6. **HTTPS Development Server**:
   - Added script for testing PWA features locally
   - Generates SSL certificates for proper PWA testing
   
7. **Next.js Integration**:
   - Client component wrapper for all PWA functionality
   - Proper handling of client-side APIs in Next.js App Router
   - SSR-safe implementation of browser features

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. Start the HTTPS development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:https
   ```

2. Test on iOS devices using Safari

3. Use the notification demo component to test push notifications

### For Users

1. Visit the TABU website in Safari on iOS
2. Use the "Add to Home Screen" option from the share menu
3. Launch from the home screen icon
4. Accept notification permissions when prompted

## Limitations

- PWA push notifications require iOS 16.4 or later
- Must be added to home screen for full functionality
- Some native features still unavailable compared to App Store apps

## Next Steps

1. Create iOS-specific splash screens in various sizes
2. Enhance offline capabilities by caching more assets
3. Improve notification UI and settings
4. Add analytics to track PWA installations
5. Comprehensive testing on various iOS versions (especially 16.4+)
