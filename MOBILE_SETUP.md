# Mobile Development Setup - TABU Project

## ✅ Capacitor Sync Fixed!

The `npx cap sync` command is now working correctly. Here's what was fixed:

### Issues Resolved
1. **Server Actions**: Moved from server-side actions to client-side Firebase functions
2. **Static Export**: Re-enabled `output: 'export'` in Next.js config
3. **Web Directory**: Capacitor now correctly uses the `out` directory
4. **Build Process**: Project builds successfully for static export

### Current Status
- ✅ Android sync working perfectly
- ✅ Web assets copied to Android project
- ✅ Capacitor plugins configured

## Available Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev                # Start Next.js dev server (localhost:9002)
npm run build              # Build for production (creates 'out' directory)
```

### Mobile Development
```bash
npx cap sync              # Sync web assets to native projects
npx cap sync android      # Sync only Android

npx cap run android       # Build and run on Android device/emulator
```

### Capacitor Management
```bash
npx cap add android       # Add Android platform (already done)
npx cap open android      # Open Android project in Android Studio
```

## Development Workflow

### For Web Development
1. `npm run dev` - Start development server
2. Make changes to your code
3. View at http://localhost:9002

### For Mobile Development
1. Make changes to your code
2. `npm run build` - Build static files
3. `npx cap sync` - Copy to native projects
4. `npx cap run android` - Test on Android

### For Mobile with Live Reload (Optional)
If you want to test on mobile while developing:
1. Uncomment the server config in `capacitor.config.ts`
2. Make sure your mobile device can reach your development machine
3. Update the URL to your machine's IP address
4. `npx cap sync`

## Next Steps

### Android Development
- Install Android Studio
- Set up an Android device or emulator
- Run `npx cap run android`

## Architecture Changes Made

### Before (Server Actions)
```typescript
// src/app/actions.ts
'use server';
export async function updatePageContent(...) { ... }
```

### After (Client-side Firebase)
```typescript
// src/lib/firestore-service.ts
export async function updatePageContent(...) { ... }
```

This change allows the app to work with static export while maintaining all Firebase functionality.

## Firebase Configuration
Make sure your `.env.local` file has the correct Firebase credentials:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# ... other Firebase config
```

The app will work offline with the static build and sync data when Firebase is properly configured.
